This repository has been created in order to demonstrate the Bipolar (AMI and Pseudoternary) 
schemes of encoding binary data while transmission.

Additionally, we have also demonstrated the working of Unipolar-NRZ and BiPolar-NRZ as well. 

USER MANUAL :

    The web applet includes a simple input field to input binary data 
    (if any other form of data is entered, an error message is generated).
    Once the data is entered, the viewer can choose any one of the coding 
    schemes (represented by buttons on the applet).
    Once the scheme is chosen, a graph is generated representing how the binary
    data is represented as a signal.
    Reset button clears the graph and the input field making the applet reagy to take new input.

We have used the charts.js library in order to simulate the graph, and used jQuery in order to 
implement the required interactivity.
Further, a CSS library, Bootstrap has been used to make the site user friendly.
